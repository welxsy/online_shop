Each category is divided into several subcategories.

All products are stored in a database (see appendices).

At the current stage of development, the database contains products **only for the Gadgets and Computers categories**.

Only **authorized users** are allowed to add products to the **Cart**, where they can later proceed to checkout or remove items.
